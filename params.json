Plexon support should be very easy to add in using plexon’s matlab code.\r\n* High quality waveform displays.\r\n* Sort by hand-picked waveform samples or run PCA on parts of waveforms.\r\n* Sufficiently fast on a modern desktop machine, but its matlab, so its not as snappy as some other programs.\r\n* Automatic noise rejection based on co-occurrence of spikes in too many channels.\r\n* Re-compute PCA (or other features) on subsets of spikes.\r\n* Display and sort non-stationary clusters.\r\n* Wavelet features (see Rodrigo Quian Quiroga’s excellent wave_clus).\r\n* Batch pre-processing and batch sorting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I wrote this software for my own use, and little time was spent testing it in different scenarios, or in making the code pretty. \r\nSimpleclust is released under the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Manual\r\nrun simple_clust.m in matlab to start.\r\nSee manual.png for a (slightly outdated) function overview.\r\n\r\nAlso, check my website at www.mit.edu/~jvoigts for posts that explain features of simpleclust \r\n\r\nSee the header of simple_clust.m for a feature list and some more info.","google":"UA-38098065-1","tagline":"manual spike clustering software for matlab"}
